ESP32 Touchscreen Display Project
Overview
This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller along with a touchscreen display to showcase various system attributes. The touchscreen interface allows users to interact with the system and view real-time data such as voltage, current, power, temperature, Amp-Hour, and Watt-Hour. 
A graphical user interface (GUI) library is employed to create a beautiful and intuitive interface for the display. The ESP32 communicates with the peripherals and sensors to gather data and dynamically update the display accordingly.

Features
Touchscreen Display: Utilizes an interactive touchscreen interface to display and navigate through different system attributes.
Real-time Monitoring: Displays real-time data including voltage, current, power, temperature, Amp-Hour, and Watt-Hour.
GUI Library: Incorporates a GUI library to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface for the display.
ESP32 Microcontroller: Controls the operation of the touchscreen display and communicates with peripherals and sensors.
Expandability: The project can be expanded to include additional sensors or functionality as required.
Components Used
ESP32 Microcontroller
Touchscreen Display (ILI9341, Touch Driver:-XPT2046)
Sensors for voltage, current, temperature
Peripherals for communication (ESP32 in build Bluetooth)
LVGL(Light Vesatile Graphics Library)
